Software : set of instructions to hardware (hardware means Monitor,CPU,Keyboard)
Programming :  writing the instructions (to create software) these instructions are called as  'programming'.
Code :    the instructions that we write to create software is called 'code' 
Programming Language : we should give instructions in a language that computer understands,these languages are called as 'Programming Language'
 Ex: something communicate to the System or Cpmputer

Syntax :  Similar to grammer rules in english,hindi. each programming language has a unique set of rules , therse rules are called as 'Syntax' of programming language.

there are different types of programming languages like Python,c,,c++,c#,,java,java script ,PHP,Go,and Ruby,Kotlin,Dart,Scala,R,C
Online Historical Encyclopaedia of Programming Languages: Estimates that there are about 8,000 to 8,945 coding languages.


Python is a versatile language ,
has applications in almost every field ( wide range of domains)

Applications : Aritifical Intelligence ,  Machine Learning ,Big Data , Smart devices and internet of things ,Game Development and web development ,Backend development.
Major Tech Companies are used python extensively.
plenty of opportunities: ML Engineer , Python Developer , Devops Engineer, Software developer and Data Analyst and Data scientist.

INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON:
Python is an easy-to-learn and powerful object oriented programming language and it is high level popular programming language , It was created by Guido van rossum and released by 1991 0.90 version.
it is used for 
Web Development(Server-Side)
Software Development 
Mathematics
System Scripting

WHY PYTHON :
1.Easy to Learn : python is comparatively an easier to use language as compared to other programming language
2.Expressive Language : the syntax of python is closer to how you would write pseudo code. which makes it capable of expressing the code's purpose better than many other languages.
3.Interpreted Language : python is an interpreted language this means that the python installation interprets and executes the code a line at a time
4.python is one of the most popular programming langauges to be used in web development owing to the variety of web development platy forms built over it like DJango,Flask etc.,


python works different platforms like windows,mac,linux,raspberry pi etc.,
python is simple syntax similar to the english language
fewer lines of code compare to other langauges
python runs on an interpreter system,meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written this means that prototyping can be very quick.
python can treated in procedural way,an object oriented way or a functional way.

Good to Know:

the most recent major version of python is 3.13, which we will shall be using in this tutorial .how ever python 2 although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular

in this tutorial, python will be written in a text editor .it is possible to write in an integrated development environment (IDE) , such as thonny,pycharm,net beans, or ecipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collection of python files

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages:

python was designed for readability and has some similarites to the english language with influennce from mathematics.
python uses new lines to complete a command as opposed to other programming languages which often as semicolons parenthesis
python relies on indentation,using white space to define scope , such as scope of loops,functions and classes, other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.



print("Hello World!")

we are adding quotes : print("2+5") -op:2+5
we are not adding quotes :print(2+5) -op:7

arithematic operators : + ,-, *,/

Variables and data types:
variables are like containers , storing values
values in the variables can be changed.

Ex:
a=5
a =6
b=7
c=8

DATA TYPE : in programming languages , every value or data has an associated type to it known as 'data type'

this data type determines how the values or data can be used in the program for example mathematical operations can be done on integer and float types of data.

types of data types:
String,Interger,Float,Boolean

STRING : string is a stream of characters enclosed within the quotes. (both single and double quotes are considered as Strings)
special characters :  (~`!@#$%^&*() -_+={}[]:;"',.<>?/ \)
Capital Letters  : A to Z
Small Letters : a to z
Digits: 0 to 9
space  
eg: "Rakesh",'vIN',   '1234'.  '0.203I0R034I'

Interger :
All whole numbers (positive and negative and zero)
but without any fractional part comes under Interger type.

eg:-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4.............................

Mathematical value or String value : '2' -> String or 2 ->Interger

4.2 where 2 is the fractional part and . is the decimal point

Float :
Any number with decimal point
e.g:24.5,22.6,877,5,-444.6

2 -interger
2.0 - Float
'2' or '2.0' - String

Boolean : 
In general sense, any thing that can take one of two possible values is considered as Boolean.

Data that has two possibilities : 
either 
 True or False 
  1 or 0 
  ON or OFF
  RIGHT or LEFT

eg: True or False (Both are start with Capital Letter)

'True' - String 
True -boolean

Assigning value to varible : 
the following syntax for assigning an interger value 10 to variable age 
age = 10 
  where = sign is called as Assignment operator 
  it is used for assiging the values to variables.


Sequence of Instructions : 
 program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer is called 'Program'
